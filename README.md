# Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the insurance company understand its customers, revenue distribution, policy performance, and claim settlement trends. It provides clarity on which policy types generate the highest premium, which age groups raise more claims, and how efficiently claims are being processed.

Since the Adult age group has the highest claim amount and Rejected claims are higher than Settled, it indicates that the company needs to improve claim support efficiency, revise policy terms, and enhance customer guidance.

With 98.87% active policies, customer retention and renewal performance is strong, reflecting high customer engagement and trust.
